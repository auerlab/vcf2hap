# vcf2hap

vcf2hap is a simple tool for generating a .hap file from a VCF.  The
.hap file is required by haplohseq (https://github.com/auerlab/vcf2hap.git).

vcf2hap is extremely fast (about 19 times faster than format_hap.py) and
requires a trivial amount of memory regardless of the size of the VCF file.
